      <p class="almonds">
        Almonds are the edible seeds of Prunus dulcis, more commonly called the
        almond tree. They are native to the Middle East, but the US is now the
        world's largest producer. The almonds you can buy in stores usually have
        the shell removed, revealing the edible nut inside. They are sold either
        raw or roasted.

      <p class="walnuts">
        A walnut is the edible seed of a drupe of any tree of the genus Juglans,
        particularly the Persian or English walnut, Juglans regia. Although
        culinarily considered a nut and used as such, it is not a true botanical
        nut. After full ripening, the shell is discarded and it is used as a
        garnish or a snack.

      <p class="peanuts">
        The peanut also known as the groundnut, goober, pindar or monkey nut, is
        a legume crop grown mainly for its edible seeds. It is widely grown in
        the tropics and subtropics, being important to both small and large
        commercial producers.
